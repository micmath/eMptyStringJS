eMptyStringJS
====

Popular JavaScript libraries have maximised code authoring efficiency by providing developers with very short names: in the cases of jQuery ($) and UnderscoreJS (_) those names are only a single character; But can we increase code writing efficiency even further? Yes! The eMptyStringJS library claims a namespace that is guaranteed to be shorter than any other available: "".

Featues
----

eMptyStringJS is a library that is highly optimised for handling strings of zero length. This is particularly useful for today's web applications that require maximal performance.

While there are many JavaScript libraries with rich string manipulation functions, in cases where the string is empty, those functions are extremely inefficient. That's where eMptyStringJS is there to help. Benchmarks prove that using eMptyStringJS instead of those heavyweight functions can be up to 900 times faster!
